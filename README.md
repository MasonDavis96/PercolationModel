# Percolation Model
A program that utilizes the Weighted Quick Union Find algorithm to simulate the effects of water percolation from top to bottom<br><br>

**NOTE:** The .txt files and the PercolationVisualizer.java class were provided. I had no involvement in the creation of that code, they were simply utiized by my Percolation.java class to draw the simulation.<br><br>


# What I Learned
* .jar file usage<br>
* API adherance<br>
* More advanced algortihm usage and manipulation<br><br>


# Usage
Run Command:<br>

`javac -cp algs4.jar *.java`<br>
`java -cp .:algs4.jar PercolationVisualizer [.txt file]`<br><br>
